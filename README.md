# Intro To W3.CCS
When I was starting to learn Bootstrap for my GitHub App,
I came across this CSS Framework that will simplify
my medium-sized project.

Having read only the introduction, I realized this 
is really great, just by adding it to your HTML,
you can start using it.

## Basic Setup
So let's have a basic Hello World

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>W3.CSS</title>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
<body>

<div class="w3-container w3-teal">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>

</body>
</html> 
```
you can use JSFiddle to run the code to see the 
result right away <https://jsfiddle.net/>

or W3schools 
<https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_hello>

this is the sample screenshot,

as you can see just by adding the line 

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">`

you are already set and start your project right away.
