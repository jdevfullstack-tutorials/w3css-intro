# Intro To W3.CCS
When I was starting to learn Bootstrap for my GitHub App,
I came across this CSS Framework that will simplify
my medium-sized project.

Having read only the introduction, I realized this 
is really great, just by adding it to your HTML,
you can start using it.

Added information when you are a beginner, in
web development, the FrontEnd is the UI, so that,
instead of using the commandline, you can display
your content in such a way that it is a presentable
website and with buttons and other components that
you can interact with.

CSS is Cascading Style Sheet to add styling to your HTML.
HTML is the skeleton of your website, it was
derived from SGML (Standardized General Markup Language)
so you can tell the computer that, for example, 
a certain word is 
a paragraph the other one is the heading.
JavaScript is the script to automate your HTML code
or to make it dynamic.

## Basic Setup
So let's have a basic Hello World

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>W3.CSS</title>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
<body>

<div class="w3-container w3-teal">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>

</body>
</html> 
```
you can use JSFiddle to run the code to see the 
result right away <https://jsfiddle.net/>

or W3schools 
<https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_hello>

this is the sample screenshot,

as you can see just by adding the line 

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">`

you are already set and start your project right away.
