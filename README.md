When I was learning Bootstrap for my GitHub App,
I came across this CSS Framework. In my mind, if 
there is anything lighter than Bootstrap but with 
comparable quality, then
it will be the best. 

Having read only the introduction, I realized this 
is really great. Just by adding the link to your HTML,
you can start using it.

Also for beginners, additional information: in
web development, the FrontEnd is the UI, so that,
instead of using the command line, you can display
your content in such a way that it is a presentable
website and with buttons and other components that
you can interact with.

CSS is Cascading Style Sheet to add styling to your HTML.
HTML is the skeleton of your website, it was
derived from SGML (Standardized General Markup Language)
so you can tell the computer that  
your text document should be displayed as an organized
document not plain text.
JavaScript is the script to automate your HTML code
or to make it dynamic.

## Basic Setup
So let's have a basic Hello World

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>W3.CSS</title>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
<body>

<div class="w3-container w3-teal">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>

</body>
</html> 
```
you can use JSFiddle to run the code to see the 
result right away <https://jsfiddle.net/>

or W3Schools 
<https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_hello>

this is the sample screenshot,

as you can see just by adding the line 

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">`

you are already set and start your project right away.
